This blog is about building predictive modelling with the Allstate Claim Severity Dataset. The dataset include 72 binary variables, around 45 categorical variable with more than 2 categories and 15 continuous variables. All data are perfecly anonymous. We don't know what the data represent. The Target variable is continuous and represent the claim severity. DATASET LINK:-https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity/overview
PROBLEM STATEMENT-Allstate is currently developing automated methods of predicting the cost, and hence severity, of claims. In this recruitment challenge, Kagglers are invited to show off their creativity and flex their technical chops by creating an algorithm which accurately predicts claims severity. Aspiring competitors will demonstrate insight into better ways to predict claims severity for the chance to be part of Allstateâ€™s efforts to ensure a worry-free customer experience.
